Fractal Terrain Generation process:
	Noise Generation
		create heightmap
			Notes:
				have terrain be randomly colored based off of height?
		Perlin or simplex noise?
		Ridged noise?
			Note: if gotten to work, create bodies of water?
	Alternatively, diamond-square technique
	Noise generation method gets more detail, diamond-square technique is faster and simpler
